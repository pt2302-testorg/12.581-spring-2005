  caption: The Clapeyron slopes of mantle phase boundaries and mantle convection.
    Near a phase boundary with positive Clapeyron slope (top), materials in cold region
    transform to high-pressure phase (denser) at shallower depth than those in hot
    region. Instead, near a phase boundary with negative Clapeyron slope (bottom),
    materials in hot region transform to high-pressure phase (denser) at shallower
    depth than those in cold region. Therefore, phase boundary together with temperature
    difference results in density anomaly near phase boundary. (Image by Prof. Sang-heon
    Shim.)
